### StreamHub: A Secure Online Video Streaming Web Application

## Project Description:
StreamHub is a robust online video streaming platform built using C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and htdocs. This web application enables users to stream video content securely over HTTPS, ensuring privacy and data protection. StreamHub offers a seamless and responsive interface for browsing, uploading, and streaming videos, with real-time transcoding and playback optimization for various devices. By combining server-side C++ for performance-critical tasks and a front-end developed using modern web technologies, StreamHub provides a highly scalable and secure streaming experience.

### Features

- **Secure HTTPS streaming**: Ensures encrypted and secure video streaming.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a fluid user experience across devices.
- **Real-time video transcoding**: Server-side C++ handles performance-intensive video processing.
- **Upload & Stream**: Users can upload their videos to be processed and streamed.
- **Fast streaming**: Optimized playback speed and quality for various network conditions.
- **Cross-browser support**: Compatible with modern browsers.

## Tech Stack

- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-end**: C++ (for processing and transcoding)
- **Server**: htdocs directory (Apache Server)
- **Security**: HTTPS encryption for secure streaming
- **Deployment**: Local or cloud-based deployment on Apache server using htdocs.

## Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/streamhub.git
cd streamhub

2.Setting up Apache Server (htdocs)
Install and configure Apache Server. Ensure that the htdocs directory is properly set up.
Move the project files into the htdocs folder (e.g., C:/xampp/htdocs/streamhub).
Enable HTTPS on your Apache server:
Generate an SSL certificate using OpenSSL or any other preferred method.
Update the Apache httpd.conf file to include the following:
bash
Copy code
Listen 443
<VirtualHost *:443>
    DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/streamhub"
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile "path_to_cert.pem"
    SSLCertificateKeyFile "path_to_key.pem"
</VirtualHost>
3. Back-End Setup (C++)
Make sure your system has a C++ compiler (such as GCC) installed.
Navigate to the backend/ folder and compile the C++ server code:
bash
Copy code
g++ server.cpp -o server
./server
This will start the video transcoding service that handles the streaming operations.
4. Front-End Setup (HTML, CSS, JS)
Navigate to the frontend/ folder to edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files if necessary.
Make sure that the front-end files are linked correctly to the back-end for streaming.
The default homepage will be accessible via https://localhost/streamhub once the Apache server is running.
5. Testing
Launch the web application by accessing https://localhost/streamhub in your browser.
You can now upload and stream videos securely over HTTPS.
Usage
Home Page: Browse through a list of available video content or upload your own.
Upload Video: Upload a video file, which will be processed in real-time by the C++ back-end.
Stream Video: Select a video to stream. The application will handle the transcoding and ensure optimal playback for your device.
Security
HTTPS Encryption: The application supports secure video streaming using SSL certificates, ensuring data privacy and protection.
Input Validation: All user inputs are validated to prevent potential attacks.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention: The front-end is secured against XSS attacks by sanitizing user input.
